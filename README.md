Starts my own creation, will keep going with Hazel video but mainly will foucs on Physics now.

Today's work: elastic collision with 10 balls
Todo: 
1, need to create better API for the scene, like how many balls/width and height etc
2, improve the collision detection function, now is O(n^2), which is stupid
3, Add debug tools and Frame rate
